tech stack:
- Vue.js ( Nuxt )
- Pinia ( storage )
- Prime Vue ( UI Components )
- Firestore ( DB )
- Storage ( Static Files repo )

Apart from app files there are python scripts to prepare photos for the website presentation:
1. convert from jpg/png to webp
2. resize images to fit the page (from each photo i make a preview one and one for fit screen ratio)
3. set file holding photos paths for the app to take them from the server and display
